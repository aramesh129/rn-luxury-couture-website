      <button class="faq-question">
        <span class="faq-icon">▼</span>
        <span>Before Booking: How far in advance should I book my appointment?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><strong>For Brides:</strong> We recommend scheduling your first fitting <strong>4 to 6 months</strong> before your wedding date. Booking too early increases risk of weight fluctuation, which would require re-adjustments and additonal fees, and may not garuntee availability</p>
        <p><strong>For Gala, Bridesmaid, and Prom Dresses:</strong> We suggest booking a minimum of 2 weeks in advance, please note that during peak season (late March, April, and May), demand is higher, and may require up to <strong>4 weeks</strong> notice.</p>

        <span class="faq-icon">▼</span>
        <span>The Process: What happens at the first fitting, and who can join me?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">

        <p><strong>Guests:</strong> For brides, two guests are the ideal number of companions. If you need more, please confirm this in advance by emailing us in advance.</p>

      <button class="faq-question">
        <span class="faq-icon">▼</span>
        <span>Turnaround Time: What is the estimated time of completion for alterations, and do you handle urgent orders?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Here is the text from the image, formatted as requested:

    <p><strong>Standard turnaround time:</strong> Approximately <strong>two weeks</strong> from your first appointment, <strong>provided the alteration does not require additional fittings.</strong> This time can vary because sometimes we must finish one adjustment (like the hem) before proceeding to the next (like the bodice adjustment), which extends the overall process. We will give you a precise time estimate during your consultation.</p> <p><strong>Rush service:</strong> Yes, we accept rush orders subject to our current availability. A service is considered urgent if the turnaround time is <strong>2 weeks or less.</strong> These orders carry a <strong>rush fee</strong> starting at $25, which may vary based on the complexity of the garment.</p>

    <p>The final fit is approved based on your current body size. <strong>RN Luxury Cousute LLC. is not responsible</strong> for changes in fit due to subsequent weight fluctuations.

        <p>We understand that most of our dresses are high-value and delicate. <strong>We always handle your garment with the utmost care and respect.</strong> However, altering existing garments, especially those with <strong>delicate fabrics, lace, beading, or vintage</strong> pieces, carries an inherent risk.</p> <p><strong>Acknowledged Risks:</strong> During the process, <strong>pre-existing defects, age-related fragility, or weaknesses</strong> in the fabric may become apparent. <strong>RN Luxury Couture LLC. is not responsible</strong> for damage, tearing, or discoloration caused by these underlying conditions of the garment.</p> <p><strong>Adjustments Not Recommended:</strong> If certain extreme adjustments are <strong>not recommended</strong> due to the fabric or construction, and the client chooses to proceed under this warning, the work is done <strong>at the client's own risk.</strong></p> <p><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> In the unlikely event of confirmed damage resulting from <strong>gross negligence</strong> by our team, our monetary liability is strictly limited to <strong>the cost of the alteration services you have paid.</strong></p>
